# ALT Atomic Image

The base image of **ALT Linux** in the form of an OCI image, compatible with **bootc**.

This image has been specifically designed to be minimalistic, making it suitable for building atomic distributions similar to Fedora Silverblue, Vanilla OS, and others.

The image does not include a graphical environment (DE) or some additional utilities, but it does contain a kernel and useful container tools such as:

- **Podman**
- **Docker**

You can view the complete list of packages in the file [./src/packages/01-package-list.sh](./src/packages/01-package-list.sh)
